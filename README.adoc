= Gradle Magic Wands

âœ¨ A set of enchanted Gradle plugins that simplify and automate common build configurations, making your development workflow smoother and more magical!
ðŸš€

== Plugin Types

The plugins are divided into two types:

1. *Convention*: These plugins automatically configure existing plugins, serving as basic building blocks.
2. *Plugins*: These are composed of Convention plugins and others, simplifying configuration for common tasks.

== Usage Examples

Usage examples can be found in the `examples` project within this repository.

== Key Features

These plugins enable:

- Creation of Spring Starter repositories.
- Simplification of library builds for Java or Kotlin.
- Streamlining configuration of Spring Boot application modules by hiding explicit plugin version declarations, their setup, and repository configurations.
- Configuration of Compose (Jetpack Compose) and KMM (Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile) projects.

== Goal

The goal is to minimize manual configuration and standardize setups.

== Plugin Management

The repository provides a `catalog.toml` file, which serves as a centralized plugin catalog.
This file allows you to declare and manage Gradle plugins in a structured way, making it easier to reuse them across projects.

To use the plugin catalog, you need to include it in your Gradle build configuration.
Below is an example of how to connect the catalog and apply plugins from it:

[source,kotlin,subs="+attributes"]
----
// settings.gradle.kts
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
    versionCatalogs {
        create("zenhelixPlugins") {
            from("io.github.zenhelix:gradle-magic-wands-catalog:{versionPlaceholder}")
        }
    }
}

// build.gradle.kts
plugins {
    alias(zenhelixPlugins.plugins.example.plugin)
}
----

This approach ensures consistent plugin management and simplifies updates across multiple projects.

The plugin automatically applies the following configurations:

- **ES Modules**: Configures the Kotlin/Wasm target to use ES modules, which are the modern standard for JavaScript module systems.
- **TypeScript Definitions**: Automatically generates TypeScript definitions (`*.d.ts` files) for Kotlin code, making it easier to interoperate with TypeScript projects.
- **Compiler Options**: Sets the JavaScript target to `es2015` and enables the `-Xir-per-file` compiler option for better performance and compatibility.

=== Spring Boot Convention

This plugin simplifies the configuration of Spring Boot projects by applying common conventions and settings.
It ensures that your Spring Boot project is set up with best practices, including repository configuration, build info generation, and task ordering.

The plugin provides the following features to enhance your Spring Boot development experience:

- **Repository Configuration**: Automatically configures the appropriate repositories (milestone or snapshot) based on the Spring Boot version being used.

- **Build Info Generation**: Ensures that the `bootBuildInfo` task is configured to generate build information, which can be useful for tracking builds and versions.

- **Task Ordering**: Ensures that the `bootBuildInfo` task runs after the `compileJava` task, maintaining the correct order of operations during the build process.

- **Spring Convention Plugin Integration**: Automatically applies the `SpringConventionPlugin` if it is available in the classpath, further simplifying the setup of Spring projects.

=== Spring Convention

This plugin simplifies the configuration of Spring projects that use Kotlin.
It ensures that common Spring and Kotlin configurations are applied, such as enabling JSR-305 null-safety, applying Kotlin plugins for Spring support, and setting up task dependencies.

The plugin provides the following features to enhance your Spring and Kotlin development experience:

- **JSR-305 Null-Safety**: Configures the Kotlin compiler to enforce strict null-safety using the `-Xjsr305=strict` compiler option, which is particularly useful for Spring projects that rely on null-safety annotations.

- **Kotlin Plugin Integration**: Automatically applies the following Kotlin plugins if they are available in the classpath:
- **Kapt**: Enables Kotlin annotation processing.
- **All-Open**: Makes classes open by default, which is required for Spring to proxy them.
- **No-Arg**: Generates no-argument constructors for classes, which is useful for JPA entities.
- **Spring Plugin**: Applies Spring-specific configurations to the `all-open` plugin.

- **Task Ordering**: Ensures that the `compileJava` task depends on the `processResources` task, maintaining the correct order of operations during the build process.
